  abstract = "In this paper we consider hyperbolic systems with
                relaxation in which the relaxation time
                $\textbackslashvarepsilon$ may vary from values of
                order one to very small values. When
                $\textbackslashvarepsilon$ is very small, the
                relaxation term becomes very strong and highly
                stiff, and underresolved numerical schemes may
                produce spurious results. In such cases it is
                important to have schemes that work uniformly with
                respect to
                $\textbackslashvarepsilon$. IMplicit-EXplicit (IMEX)
                Runge?Kutta (R-K) schemes have been widely used for
                the time evolution of hyperbolic partial
                differential equations but the schemes existing in
                literature do not exhibit uniform accuracy with
                respect to the relaxation time. We develop new IMEX
                R-K schemes for hyperbolic systems with relaxation
                that present better uniform accuracy than the ones
                existing in the literature and in particular produce
                good behavior with high order accuracy in the
                asymptotic limit, i.e., when
                $\textbackslashvarepsilon$ is very small. These
                schemes are obtained by imposing new additional
                order conditions to guarantee better accuracy over a
                wide range of the relaxation time. We propose the
                construction of new third-order IMEX R-K schemes of
                type CK . In several test problems, these schemes,
                with a fixed spatial discretization, exhibit for all
                range of the relaxation time an almost uniform
                third-order accuracy."}
