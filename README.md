The odeToJava package is a problem solving environment (PSE) designed
to facilitate the development and prototyping of algorithms for
solving Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE).

The odeToJava packages is detailed in the paper found at https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2641563 and given by the reference:

A. Kroshko and R.J. Spiteri. odeToJava: A PSE for the numerical solution of IVPs. ACM Trans Math Softw, 41(3):17:1â€“17:33, 2015.

Although no longer under development, I will happily accept any bug fixes or other maintenance work required.
